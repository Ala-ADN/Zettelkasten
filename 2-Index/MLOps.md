- Applying DevOps principles to Machine learning
- a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain models in production reliably and efficiently

## Motivation
1. Strong coupling between data collection model training and deployment step
2. It is necessary to make changes to each step due to:
	- Model performance decay
	- Changes in business objectives
	- Violation of assumptions thus problem reformulation
## Phases
- [[Data Engineering]]
- [[Model Engineering]]
- [[Model Deployment]]
